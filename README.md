# Saguaro Design Kit
UI kit and workflow documentation for designers working with [Project Saguaro](https://github.com/ponchofreedo/project-saguaro "Project Saguaro").

## Notes
There are a few extras that go along with the system. I'm currently in the process of rebuilding the library itself, but use of the color palette is highly recommended instead of just shooting from the hip.

## Installation
+ Clone to a local directory
+ Toggle plugins > Sketch Palettes > load 'library/tentrr-colors.sketchpalette' (if using sketch palettes)

## Dependencies / Recommendations
+ [Shared text styles](https://github.com/nilshoenson/shared-text-styles)
+ [Sketch Palettes](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes)
